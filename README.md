This portable .exe file is a complete Windows 1252 character panel. It displays Hex, Decimal, and String values for characters 0 - 255. Best of all, it's a keyboard! Just double click on a character to insert it wherever the cursor is!
The program appears on top of normal windows and doesn't accept focus, so that you can keep typing even if you click something in it.

## Settings

- Opacity Slider (50% - 100%)

### Show Control Characters
Not all characters of Windows 1252 are part of the alphabet. Some of them serve a special function, and thus they are hidden by default. They appear red in color when shown, and are not inserted at the cursor when you double click them.

### Sort Lexicographically
I took the word lexicographically maybe too literally. Lexico - the first set of characters are numbers, then lowercase letters, then uppercase letters. Graphically - The rest of the characters are sorted into categories of function or just appearance. Control Characters are at the end.

### Transparent
A quick setting to switch between 70% and 100% opacity.

### Opacity Slider (50% - 100%)
This slider allows for a finer adjustment of the opacity, where any integer in the range is allowed.
